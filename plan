ModelState

Holds id, relationship, and attribute data.
Maybe unloading?

Questions

Embedded records set to null
What to do about _implicitRelationships
Should default value be in the snapshot?


Do we need a hook for record destroy?
Snapshot interface?

Talk to yehuda about value of schemas for attributes


Maybe we transmit the priority of data in json api resource, or by not including data

If we keep track of loaded links, when do we unload?

Make sure ModelData can be upgraded over time

Currently not caching link promises, make sure that happens
Add tests for store client ids
add cleanup for clientIds

creation allows people to pass store in easily
check if data is ever passed to internalModel constructor
consider notify properties change for has many
I wonder if we currently leak many arrays
